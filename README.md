# Clustering-
Clustering 
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together. The goal is to partition data into clusters where objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

Types of Clustering Algorithms

1. Partition-based Clustering

K-Means: Divides data into K clusters based on distance to centroids.

K-Medoids (PAM): Similar to K-Means but uses actual data points as centroids.



2. Hierarchical Clustering

Agglomerative: Starts with individual points and merges them iteratively.

Divisive: Starts with all data points in one cluster and splits them iteratively.



3. Density-based Clustering

DBSCAN: Finds clusters based on density and can identify outliers.

OPTICS: Similar to DBSCAN but adapts to varying densities.



4. Model-based Clustering

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): Uses probability distributions to assign points to clusters.



5. Graph-based Clustering

Spectral Clustering: Uses eigenvalues of similarity matrices to perform clustering.




Applications of Clustering

Customer Segmentation (e.g., marketing and sales)

Anomaly Detection (e.g., fraud detection)

Document and Text Clustering (e.g., topic modeling)

Image Segmentation (e.g., object recognition)

Genomic Data Analysis (e.g., gene expression studies)
